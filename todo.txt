Next Steps:

- reproduce results with gda on input layer
- experiment with hidden layers


More:

- debug why no checkpoint is saved apart from last.ckpt even when save_top_k > 1
- can improve:
    - statistics about latent space
    - sampling around an embedding in latent space exploration (more options, e.g. sample at multiple
      gaussian noise levels or do a MCMC guided by probas)
- implement other autoencoder variants (e.g. VAE, VQVAE)
- to understand hidden layer perturbations (of any kind, including through a perturbation in the latent space on an AE),
  setup the following: given a dataset and a classifier, collect all hidden representations at that level of the datapoints.
  then, do nearest neighbor queries to interpret the 'moves' in hidden representation space.
